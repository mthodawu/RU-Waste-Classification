## The code implementation of the Honours Research project titled: "Using Machine Learning Algorithms to classify recyclable waste"

### Abstract
Waste management poses a significant global challenge, with 90% of South Africa's waste directed to landfills, leading to environmental and health risks. In regions like Agbogbloshie, Ghana, manual waste sorting exposes workers to hazardous conditions, underscoring the need for safer, more efficient recycling practices. This research addresses the critical issue of waste classification by exploring the application of machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automate the sorting of recyclable materials. By accurately classifying waste into categories such as paper, plastics, glass, metals, cardboard, and organic materials, the proposed system aims to reduce landfill waste, promote recycling, and create safer working environments.

The study is grounded in a positivist paradigm, employing empirical evidence to train and evaluate machine learning models. Binary and multi-class classification tasks are performed, highlighting the performance of CNNs in distinguishing waste types. While binary classification demonstrates high accuracy for specific materials, multi-class classification reflects real-world complexities in sorting mixed waste streams. Though limited in its effectiveness for class imbalance, data augmentation points to potential improvements through oversampling techniques. Ultimately, this research contributes to the development of automated waste sorting systems, enhancing recycling efficiency and reducing the environmental footprint of waste disposal.
